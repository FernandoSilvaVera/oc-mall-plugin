<SpoilerStd label="Required Actions">

### Update your index

Due to an error, some products and variants (as well as their properties), were not indexed 
correctly, whereupon filter options may not work properly or other errors may be caused. Thus, it is 
highly recommended to use the command `php artisan mall:index` to completely renew the index.
